## Reflection
### Model
A simple Kinematic model is used, with the model equations as:

```
x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
y[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
psi[t+1] = psi[t] - v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt
v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt
epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt
```

where `x, y` deonte the car position, `psi` is the heading direction, `v` is the velocity, `cte` is the cross track error and `epsi` is the orientation error.

This model neglects any complex interactions between tires and the road. Moreover, the constant, `Lf` is the distance between the car of mass and the front wheels. The goal is to get outputs, `a` the acceleration and `delta` the steering angle. 

The solution should minimize the objective function defined [here](https://github.com/bkanaki/CarND-MPC-Project/blob/d6a5f4fa64f5309952a6c5b39c2c880769a9a37f/src/MPC.cpp#L41).

### Timestep and Elapsed Duration.
The timestep (N) is chosen such that the updates are real-time and there is no lag. A high value of N would assume that it would have to solve for a larger dimensional vector which would slow down the calculations, whereas, very low value of N would lead to jerky motion. Here, N is chosen as 8. The other parameter, Elapsed duration between timesteps (dt) is chosen to be 0.1 second by following the MPC Project Q&A.

### Polynomial Fitting
The waypoints provided by the simulator are transformed to the car coordinate system. Then a 3rd-degree polynomial is fitted to the these waypoints. The polynomial coefficients obtained are used to calculate the `cte` and `epsi` later on. They are used by the solver as well to create a reference trajectory.

### Latency
As mentioned in the class notes: "In a real car, an actuation command won't execute instantly - there will be a delay as the command propagates through the system. A realistic delay might be on the order of 100 milliseconds."

Following [this](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/how-to-incorporate-latency-into-the-model/257391/4) thread, I calculated the states by assuming 100 ms latency and updating them using the same model as described above before passing it to the solver.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
